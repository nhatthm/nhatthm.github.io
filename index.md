## Hello World

Hey,

Hi there, I'm quite busy at the moment with the work from my company and need to balance between work - wife - life, you know... so no interesting content at the moment.

I'm trying to travel whenever I can, so far I've been to
- Vietnam (of course, my home)
- Laos (just 10km from the border)
- Cambodia
- Singapore
- Thailand
- Malaysia
- Myanmar
- China
- UAE
- Poland
- Malta
- Italy
- Belgium
- Luxembourg
- Czech
- Slovakia
- Austria
- Hungary
- Switzerland
- Liechtenstein
- and... Germany

If you're interested in working with me, check [this](https://www.hellofresh.com/careers/locations/de) out and drop me an email at `contact [at] nhat [dot] me`

And just in case, you know, for networking... [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhatthm/) ;)

Alright, that's it

Cheers
